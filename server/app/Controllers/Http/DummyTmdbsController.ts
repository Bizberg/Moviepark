                overview: 'Candice Renoir had put her career on standby for 10 years. When she  returns from Singapore to resume service in a port town in the south of  France, she feels a bit “rusty”. Despite the obvious defiance of her  unit and a cynical superior who doesn’t make her job any easier, she is  determined to turn her so-called weaknesses into strengths, solving the  most complex cases with her common sense, her acute observation and her  practical nature seasoned by a busy daily routine.\n\nOnly Candice can  catch a killer because she knows the chemical composition of a  window-cleaning product or determine the hour of a murder from the  cooking-time of kebabs… Candice is only naive on the outside, and nobody  can resist her!',
